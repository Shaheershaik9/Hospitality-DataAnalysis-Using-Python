𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄:
In the competitive world of luxury hotels, AtliQ Grands, a 5-star hotel chain in India, was facing revenue challenges that risked its market position. As a Data Analyst, I took on the challenge to use data-driven insights to support smarter decision-making and help transform the fortunes of this esteemed hotel chain.

𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗔𝘁𝗹𝗶𝗤 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘀:

•	AtliQ Grands operates in four major cities, with a network of seven upscale properties strategically located to cater to a diverse clientele.
•	The hotels offer four room categories: Elite, Premium, Presidential, and Standard, providing tailored experiences for guests.
•	Reservations are available on six popular booking platforms, ensuring convenient and accessible booking options for guests.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲:
My goal was to conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis to reveal booking trends, identify high-performing properties, and uncover areas for revenue optimization. I used several datasets in this analysis:

•	𝗱𝗶𝗺_𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲: Includes date-related details such as week numbers and day types (weekday/weekend). This table was essential for analyzing booking patterns over time.

•	𝗱𝗶𝗺_𝗵𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗹𝘀: Contains information on property ID, name, category, and city. This dataset helped us understand the characteristics of each property.

•	𝗱𝗶𝗺_𝗿𝗼𝗼𝗺𝘀: Details room IDs and room classes, providing insight into room popularity and profitability.

•	𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁_𝗮𝗴𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱_𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀: A fact table with data on property ID, check-in dates, room categories, successful bookings, and capacity, used to calculate key metrics on occupancy and bookings.

Through this analysis, we aimed to provide actionable insights to drive revenue growth and maintain AtliQ Grands’ prestigious market standing.
